# Tennis Simulation

I created this Program for my physics seminar work.
You can simulate different trajectories of tennis balls using the principle of small steps, which provides a high degree of accuracy. 

Feel free to use my program and code. If you are just intrested in the program, you can find it in out/artifacts
Have a nice day.
