# Tennis Simulation

I created this program for my physics seminar work.
You can simulate different trajectories of tennis balls using the principle of small steps, which provides a high degree of accuracy. 

Feel free to use my program and code. If you are just intrested in the program, you can find it in *out/artifacts/tennis-sim-jar*

Have a nice day.




NOTE: The program must be ran on a display with a pixel aspect ratio of 1:1, otherwise you get distorted trajectories.
